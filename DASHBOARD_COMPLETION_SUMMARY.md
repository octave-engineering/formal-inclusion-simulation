## üí° Key Messages for Stakeholders

1. **No More Circular Logic**
   - The model no longer uses variables that indicate existing formal inclusion
   - This makes it more useful for identifying who would benefit from financial services

2. **Savings Behavior Focus**
   - 7 new variables capture savings culture and financial planning
   - These are strong predictors of formal inclusion readiness
   - All are actionable through savings promotion programs

3. **Policy Actionability**
   - Every variable can be influenced by policy interventions
   - Education, economic support, and savings promotion all have clear pathways

4. **Maintained Performance**
   - Slight accuracy decrease (75% vs 80%) is acceptable
   - Gain in interpretability and policy relevance far outweighs this
   - Model is now scientifically sound and practically useful

5. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Simplified from 52 to 15 inputs
   - Clear organization and labeling
   - Works well on mobile devices
