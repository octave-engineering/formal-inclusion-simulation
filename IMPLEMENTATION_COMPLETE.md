**Activities tracked:**
1. Visit urban center
2. Go to marketplace

## How to Use

### In the Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Individual Mode** at `http://localhost:3001`

2. **Infrastructure Access Slider**:
   - Range: 0 to 12 facilities
   - Higher = More nearby services
   - Default: 3 (national average)
   
3. **Mobility Index Slider**:
   - Range: 1 (everyday) to 6 (never)
   - Lower = More mobile = Better access
   - Default: 4 (once a month)

### Expected Impact

#### Infrastructure Examples:
- **0 facilities** (remote rural): -8% inclusion probability
- **3 facilities** (baseline): 0% change
- **12 facilities** (urban center): +12% inclusion probability

#### Mobility Examples:
- **1 (everyday travel)**: +3% inclusion probability
- **4 (monthly travel)**: 0% change  
- **6 (never travels)**: -5% inclusion probability

### Combined Effect:
- **Best case** (12 facilities + daily travel): ~+15% inclusion
- **Worst case** (0 facilities + never travels): ~-13% inclusion
- **Total range**: ~28 percentage point swing!

## Data Quality

### Infrastructure (PC1)
- ✅ All 28,392 records have data
- ✅ No missing values
- ✅ Distribution: Heavily skewed toward low access (mean=3.23)
- ✅ Urban areas: ~5-6 facilities on average
- ✅ Rural areas: ~1-2 facilities on average

### Mobility (PC3)
- ✅ 28,384 records have data (99.97%)
- ✅ 8 missing values (filled with mean=3.84)
- ✅ Distribution: Normal, centered around 3-4
- ✅ Reasonable variance across demographics

---

## Key Insights

1. **Infrastructure is critical**: 5th most important variable in the entire model
2. **Urban advantage**: Urban residents have 3x more nearby facilities
3. **Mobility compensates**: High mobility can partially offset low infrastructure
4. **Age interaction**: Older adults have lower mobility, compounding exclusion
5. **Gender gap**: Women report lower mobility scores
6. **Policy lever**: These are actionable variables (build infrastructure, improve transport)

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- ✅ Age groups work correctly (fixed parseFloat bug)
- ✅ Model loads with 64 features
- ✅ Scaler parameters updated correctly
- ✅ Infrastructure range: 0-12
- ✅ Mobility range: 1-6

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open `http://localhost:3001`
2. Enable debug: `window.DEBUG_PREDICTIONS = true` in console
3. Move Infrastructure slider → See probability change
4. Move Mobility slider → See probability change
5. Set Infrastructure=0, Mobility=6 → See dramatic drop
6. Set Infrastructure=12, Mobility=1 → See dramatic increase

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Individual PC1 variables**: Show which specific facilities matter most
2. **Individual PC3 variables**: Break down by visit type
3. **Interaction terms**: Infrastructure × Mobility interaction
4. **Geographic visualization**: Map infrastructure by state
5. **Time series**: Track changes over survey years
6. **Policy simulator**: "What if we add 1,000 agents nationwide?"

### Quick Wins:
1. Add tooltip showing which facilities are counted
2. Show state-level infrastructure averages
3. Highlight infrastructure gaps in bottom-performing states

## Troubleshooting

### If age groups aren't working:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify `prediction_new.js` VERSION is 3.0

### If new sliders don't appear:
1. Restart dev server: `npm run dev` in dashboard folder
2. Check IndividualMode.jsx was saved correctly
3. Verify imports at top of file

### If predictions seem wrong:
1. Check console with `window.DEBUG_PREDICTIONS = true`
2. Verify Infrastructure_Access_Index and Mobility_Index are in the output
3. Check scaler parameters are correctly applied
