CIRCULAR VARIABLES ANALYSIS - RECOMMENDATIONS
==============================================

VARIABLES TO REMOVE (Circular Logic):
-------------------------------------
  [X] TransactionalAccount - Having a transactional account IS formal inclusion
  [X] transactional_account_binary - Binary version of TransactionalAccount
  [X] MobileMoneyUsage - Mobile money accounts are formal financial services
  [X] mobile_money_binary - Binary version of MobileMoneyUsage
  [X] FinancialAgents - Using financial agents implies existing formal account
  [X] financial_agents_binary - Binary version of FinancialAgents
  [X] access_agents - Access to financial agents may indicate existing usage
  [X] access_agents_raw - Raw access to agents score
  [X] FinancialService - Type of financial service used - indicates existing inclusion
  [X] FrequentyUsedTransactionMethod - Transaction method implies existing financial service
  [X] MoneyReceivingMethod - Receiving money via formal channels indicates inclusion

VARIABLES TO KEEP (Valid Predictors):
-------------------------------------
All variables in these categories:
  [OK] Demographics (age, gender, education, marital status)
  [OK] Economic Status (income, wealth, primary money source)
  [OK] Geography (sector, region, state)
  [OK] Behavioral (savings frequency, running out of money, coping mechanisms)

NEW VARIABLES TO ADD (From Savings Behavior Analysis):
-------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Saves_Money - Indicates savings propensity without requiring formal account
  [+] Informal_Savings_Mode - Uses informal savings (NOT banks/mobile money)
  [+] Regular_Saver - Saves regularly (frequency indicator)
  [+] Diverse_Savings_Reasons - Saves for multiple purposes
  [+] Old_Age_Planning - Has financial plan for old age
  [+] Savings_Frequency_Score - Weighted savings frequency
  [+] Savings_Behavior_Score - Composite savings propensity indicator

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Remove all circular variables from the modeling dataset
2. Merge savings behavior features from savings_behavior_results/
3. Retrain the logistic regression model with:
   - Valid existing variables (demographics, economic, geographic, behavioral)
   - New savings behavior variables (non-circular indicators)
4. Update dashboard to reflect new model
5. Regenerate population_data.json with new predictions

IMPACT:
-------
- Model will now measure PROPENSITY for inclusion, not existing inclusion
- Predictions will be more meaningful for policy interventions
- Savings behavior features provide behavioral signals without circularity
