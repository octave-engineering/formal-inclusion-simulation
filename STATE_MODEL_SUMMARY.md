## State-Level Insights

### Reference State
- **ABIA** (dropped as reference, coefficient = 0)

### Top 10 States (Highest Financial Inclusion)
States with **positive coefficients** have higher financial inclusion rates than the reference state (ABIA):

| Rank | State | Coefficient | Interpretation |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **KOGI** | +0.0687 | Highest financial inclusion |
| 2 | **EDO** | +0.0600 | Very high inclusion |
| 3 | **NASARAWA** | +0.0567 | High inclusion |
| 4 | **KWARA** | +0.0533 | High inclusion |
| 5 | **CROSS RIVER** | +0.0424 | Above average |
| 6 | **FCT ABUJA** | +0.0408 | Above average (capital) |
| 7 | **DELTA** | +0.0371 | Above average |
| 8 | **EKITI** | +0.0305 | Moderate positive |
| 9 | **PLATEAU** | +0.0272 | Moderate positive |
| 10 | **LAGOS** | +0.0116 | Slightly above average |

**Note:** LAGOS having only a small positive coefficient (+0.0116) is interesting. This suggests that after controlling for urban/rural and other factors, Lagos doesn't have as strong an independent state effect as expected. This is likely because the **urban** variable already captures much of Lagos's advantage.

### Bottom 10 States (Lowest Financial Inclusion)
States with **negative coefficients** have lower financial inclusion rates than the reference state (ABIA):

| Rank | State | Coefficient | Interpretation |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **KANO** | -0.0912 | Lowest financial inclusion |
| 2 | **BAYELSA** | -0.0589 | Very low inclusion |
| 3 | **ADAMAWA** | -0.0548 | Low inclusion |
| 4 | **ZAMFARA** | -0.0492 | Low inclusion |
| 5 | **KATSINA** | -0.0459 | Low inclusion |
| 6 | **ONDO** | -0.0363 | Below average |
| 7 | **BORNO** | -0.0348 | Below average |
| 8 | **IMO** | -0.0249 | Slightly below average |
| 9 | **SOKOTO** | -0.0232 | Slightly below average |
| 10 | **ANAMBRA** | -0.0197 | Slightly below average |

## Geographic Patterns

### North vs South Divide

**Northern States (Generally Lower Inclusion):**
- KANO: -0.0912 (worst)
- KATSINA: -0.0459
- ZAMFARA: -0.0492
- SOKOTO: -0.0232
- BORNO: -0.0348
- ADAMAWA: -0.0548

**Southern States (Mixed, but more positive):**
- EDO: +0.0600 (very high)
- DELTA: +0.0371
- CROSS RIVER: +0.0424
- But also BAYELSA: -0.0589 (very low)

**Middle Belt (Generally Positive):**
- KOGI: +0.0687 (highest)
- NASARAWA: +0.0567
- KWARA: +0.0533
- PLATEAU: +0.0272

### Surprising Findings

1. **LAGOS (+0.0116):** Relatively small coefficient despite being the commercial hub
   - **Explanation:** The `urban` variable captures most of Lagos's advantage
   - Once urban/rural is controlled, Lagos is only slightly better than average

2. **KANO (-0.0912):** Very large negative coefficient
   - **Explanation:** Nigeria's 2nd largest city but low financial inclusion
   - Cultural and religious factors may play a role
   - Large informal economy

3. **FCT ABUJA (+0.0408):** Moderately positive (capital city)
   - Better than average but not the highest
   - The `urban` and `wealth` variables capture much of its advantage

4. **BAYELSA (-0.0589):** Oil-rich state but low inclusion
   - **Explanation:** High income inequality, conflict, environmental degradation
   - Wealth concentrated in few hands

## Base Feature Coefficients (Unchanged Pattern)

The base features remain strong predictors, with similar coefficients to the previous model:

| Feature | Coefficient | Change from Previous |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| education_numeric | +0.7812 | -0.0008 |
| wealth_numeric | +0.7493 | -0.0147 |
| income_numeric | +0.3653 | +0.0083 |
| runs_out_of_money | +0.2269 | -0.0161 |
| savings_frequency_numeric | +0.2053 | +0.0003 |
| gender_male | +0.2003 | +0.0003 |
| urban | +0.1383 | +0.0013 |

**Note:** Coefficients are very stable, showing that state variables complement rather than replace the base features.

## Policy Implications

### National Targeting
Focus financial inclusion programs on states with the **most negative** coefficients:
1. **KANO** - Priority #1 (largest gap)
2. **BAYELSA** - Priority #2
3. **ADAMAWA** - Priority #3
4. **ZAMFARA** - Priority #4
5. **KATSINA** - Priority #5

### Regional Strategies

**Northern Nigeria:**
- Tailor products to cultural/religious preferences (Islamic finance)
- Address infrastructure gaps
- Focus on rural areas (many northern states are less urbanized)

**Niger Delta:**
- Address BAYELSA's specific challenges (conflict, inequality)
- Leverage oil wealth more effectively
- Focus on community-based programs

**Middle Belt:**
- Learn from success stories (KOGI, NASARAWA, KWARA)
- Replicate successful models in other regions

## Dashboard Integration

### Option 1: Full State Model (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- State selection actually affects prediction
- More accurate for specific locations
- Provides state-level insights

**Cons:**
- 51 features instead of 15 (more complex)
- Requires updating all dashboard components
- Slightly more computation

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach
**Pros:**
- Keep simpler 15-feature model for Individual Mode
- Add state-adjusted predictions as optional "advanced" feature
- Best of both worlds

**Cons:**
- Requires maintaining two models

### Recommendation
**Use the full state model** and update the dashboard:
1. State selection now affects predictions
2. Show state-specific financial inclusion likelihood
3. Display state's coefficient as context: "KOGI residents have 6.9% higher likelihood"

## Conclusion

✅ **State variables successfully integrated into the model**

**Key Findings:**
1. **Modest performance improvement** (+0.35 pp accuracy, +0.0026 AUC)
2. **Significant state-level variation** (range: -0.0912 to +0.0687)
3. **Clear regional patterns** (North-South divide, Middle Belt success)
4. **Policy actionability** (target KANO, BAYELSA, ADAMAWA, etc.)

**Recommendation:**
Deploy the state-enhanced model to the dashboard. The modest accuracy improvement is offset by significant gains in **interpretability** and **policy targeting**.

Users can now get state-specific predictions, and policymakers can identify which states need the most support.
