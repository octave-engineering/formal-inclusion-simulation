# Solution: Rebuild Dataset from Excel

## Problem Identified

The retraining script tried to merge:
- **Excel file** (AF2023_Efina.xlsx) - has clean column names (NIN, Mobile Phone, etc.)
  - respondent_serial values: 3697287, 3546312, 3737095...
  
- **Cleaned CSV** (modeling_dataset_non_circular.csv) - has engineered features
  - respondent_serial values: 464630, 464632, 464683...

**NO OVERLAP** between these IDs → Merge fails → All new variables become NaN → Filled with 0

## Root Cause

The cleaned dataset was created from **A2F_2023_complete.csv** which likely has different/transformed IDs.
The Excel file is a separate export with different IDs.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use the Excel file entirely (RECOMMENDED)
Re-engineer ALL features from the Excel file:
1. Load AF2023_Efina.xlsx
2. Create all base features (education_numeric, wealth_numeric, etc.)
3. Create all 7 missing features (NIN, Employment, etc.)
4. Create state dummies
5. Train model

**Pros:** Clean start, all columns available
**Cons:** Need to re-engineer base features

### Option 2: Find the correct source file
If A2F_2023_complete.csv has the same columns as the Excel file, use that instead.

**Pros:** Can use existing feature engineering
**Cons:** Need to verify column names match

### Option 3: Use row-index matching (RISKY)
If both datasets have the same number of rows in the same order, match by index.

**Pros:** Quick fix
**Cons:** Very risky - if order doesn't match, data is corrupted

## Recommended Action

**Use the Excel file as the primary source** and rebuild everything from scratch.

The Excel file (AF2023_Efina.xlsx) appears to be a cleaner version with:
- ✅ All columns we need (NIN, Mobile Phone, Salary, Business, etc.)
- ✅ Clean column names
- ✅ 28,392 rows (full dataset)
- ✅ Already has respondent_serial

We should:
1. Start fresh from AF2023_Efina.xlsx
2. Re-create the feature engineering pipeline
3. Add all 7 missing variables
4. Train the complete model

This ensures data integrity and gives us the full 58-feature model we need.
