# Variable Info Page Update Guide

## Current Status

The `VariableInfo.jsx` component currently contains **old variables** from the previous circular model. It needs to be updated to reflect the **15 non-circular variables** in the new model.

## Variables to REMOVE (Circular Variables)

These variables directly indicate existing formal inclusion and must be removed:

1. **Formal_ID_Count** - Removed (circular - indicates existing formal participation)
2. **Bank_Account** - Removed (circular - direct measure of formal inclusion)
3. **Financial_Access_Index** - Removed (circular - composite of formal services)
4. **Access_Diversity_Score** - Removed (circular - usage of formal channels)
5. **Mobile_Digital_Readiness** - Removed (not in new model)
6. **Formal_Employment_Binary** - Removed (not in new model)
7. **Business_Income_Binary** - Removed (not in new model)
8. **Agricultural_Income_Binary** - Removed (not in new model)
9. **Passive_Income_Binary** - Removed (not in new model)
10. **Income_Level_Ordinal** - Replaced with `income_numeric`
11. **Income_Diversity_Score** - Removed (not in new model)

## Why These Variables Are Non-Circular

The new model measures **propensity** for formal inclusion, not existing inclusion:

- **Demographics**: Innate characteristics, not outcomes
- **Economic Status**: Financial capacity, not formal service usage
- **Savings Behavior**: General savings culture, not formal account activity

These variables predict the **likelihood** someone would benefit from formal financial services, rather than indicating they already have them.

## Recommended Documentation Structure

### Section 1: Model Overview
- Explain the shift from circular to non-circular variables
- Highlight the 15-variable model structure
- Emphasize propensity measurement vs. outcome measurement

### Section 2: Demographics (4 variables)
- education_numeric, gender_male, urban, Age_numeric

### Section 3: Economic Status (4 variables)
- wealth_numeric, income_numeric, runs_out_of_money, savings_frequency_numeric

### Section 4: Savings Behavior (7 variables) - NEW SECTION
- All 7 savings behavior indicators
- Explain why savings behavior predicts formal inclusion
- Emphasize actionability for policy interventions

### Section 5: Model Interpretation
- How to read coefficients
- Z-score normalization explanation
- Sigmoid transformation for probabilities

## Key Messages for Users

1. **No More Circular Logic**: The model no longer includes variables like "Has_Account" or "Mobile_Money_User" which directly indicate formal inclusion.

2. **Savings Behavior Focus**: 7 new variables capture savings culture and financial planning, which are strong predictors of formal inclusion readiness.

3. **Policy Actionability**: All 15 variables are actionable through policy interventions:
   - Education: Expand schooling, financial literacy
   - Economic: Wealth redistribution, income support
   - Savings: Savings mobilization campaigns, formal savings incentives

4. **Interpretability**: The model is more interpretable - coefficients show true causal relationships, not circular correlations.

5. **Performance**: Slightly lower accuracy (75% vs 80%) but much higher interpretability and policy relevance.

## Implementation Notes

- Update variable names throughout (e.g., `Education_Ordinal` â†’ `education_numeric`)
- Update all coefficient values from `model_coefficients.json`
- Add comprehensive documentation for all 7 savings behavior variables
- Include dashboard usage examples for each variable
- Add policy implications for each variable

## Files to Reference

- `new_model_results/model_coefficients.json` - Exact coefficient values
- `rebuilt_dataset/modeling_dataset_non_circular.csv` - Variable distributions
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Full context on circular variable removal
- `dashboard/src/utils/prediction.js` - How variables are used in predictions

---

**Status**: The VariableInfo.jsx file currently contains OLD documentation and needs a complete rewrite following this guide.

**Priority**: Medium (dashboard functions without it, but users need accurate documentation)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours to write comprehensive documentation for all 15 variables
