- **Removes Barrier:** Wealth constraint (poorest quintile currently 28% vs richest 82%)

### TIER 2: HIGH PRIORITY

#### 3. National Financial Literacy Campaign

### TIER 3: MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 5. Regional Equity Programs
- **Focus:** North East and North West states

## ✨ KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Agent Access Dominates All Other Factors
The Access to Financial Agents index has a coefficient **40× larger** than most other variables. No other intervention comes close to its impact potential.

### 2. The 2020-2023 Acceleration is Unprecedented
The 15-fold increase in growth rate post-2020 suggests a structural shift—likely the confluence of:
- Digital payments necessity during COVID-19
- Maturation of agent banking regulations
- Mobile network expansion
- Youth demographic adoption

### 3. Wealth is Not Destiny
While wealth is the #3 driver, the emergence of zero-balance accounts and agent banking proves inclusion can reach lower-wealth segments when barriers are removed.

### 4. Regional Gaps Are Structural, Not Just Economic
North-South disparities persist even after controlling for wealth and education, suggesting cultural, linguistic, and security factors require targeted approaches.

### 5. Education Effect is Non-Linear
Each education level adds approximately the same marginal inclusion benefit (~12pp), suggesting interventions at any education tier are valuable.

## 🚀 IMPACT PROJECTIONS

### If Top 3 Recommendations Implemented (2024-2026)

**Agent Expansion Scenario:**
- Deploy 50,000 agents in underserved areas
- **Impact:** +8pp national inclusion → **69.2% by 2025**

**Zero-Balance Accounts:**
- Mandate implementation across all banks
- **Impact:** +5pp among lower-wealth segments → **74.2% by 2026**

**Financial Literacy Campaign:**
- Mass media + community engagement
- **Impact:** +3pp via education effect → **77.2% by 2026**

**Combined Effect:** National inclusion could reach **77% by 2026** (vs. baseline projection of 65%).

---

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS & CAVEATS

1. **Observational Data:** Associations, not causal effects (no RCT)
2. **Survey Weights Not Applied:** May affect representativeness
3. **Missing Granular Data:** Agent density per km², exact distances to branches
4. **Endogeneity:** Income/wealth both cause and effect of inclusion
5. **COVID-19 Confound:** Cannot isolate specific policy effects 2020-2023
6. **Self-Reported Data:** Potential recall bias in survey responses

---
