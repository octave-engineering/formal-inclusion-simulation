# New Features Added to Financial Inclusion Model

## Overview
Two powerful new predictors have been added to the model, significantly improving predictive accuracy:

### Model Performance
- **Previous AUC**: 0.8696
- **New AUC**: 0.8763 ⬆️
- **Test Accuracy**: 79.84%

## 1. Infrastructure Access Index (PC1)
**Feature Importance: #5 (Coefficient: +0.3928)**

### Description
Counts the number of nearby facilities accessible to the respondent (0-12):

1. Provision shop
2. Bank branch
3. Financial service agent
4. ATM
5. Microfinance bank
6. Non-interest service provider
7. Primary mortgage bank
8. Petrol station
9. Pharmacy
10. Restaurant
11. Post office
12. Mobile phone kiosk

### Impact
- **Mean**: 3.23 facilities per person
- **Effect**: Each additional facility increases formal inclusion likelihood
- **Interpretation**: Physical infrastructure access is critical for financial services adoption

### Policy Implication
Expanding financial infrastructure (especially agents, ATMs, and bank branches) in underserved areas will significantly boost inclusion rates.

## 2. Mobility Index (PC3)
**Feature Importance: #9 (Coefficient: -0.1712)**

### Description
Measures how frequently respondents visit various locations (1-6 scale):

1. Urban center
2. Marketplace
3. Family/relatives not living with you
4. Hospital/clinic
5. Community meetings/religious gatherings
6. Overnight stays away from home

**Scale:**
- 1 = Everyday (high mobility)
- 2 = Once per week
- 3 = Every 2 weeks
- 4 = Once a month
- 5 = Less than once a month
- 6 = Never (low mobility)

### Impact
- **Mean**: 3.84 (between "every 2 weeks" and "once a month")
- **Effect**: NEGATIVE coefficient (-0.17) means lower values (more mobile) = higher inclusion
- **Interpretation**: People who travel more frequently have better access to financial services

### Policy Implication
- Mobile banking and agent networks are crucial for less mobile populations
- Digital solutions can compensate for low physical mobility
- Community-based financial services (e.g., village savings groups) help immobile populations

## Combined Effect

### Synergy
These two variables work together:
- **High infrastructure + High mobility** = Best inclusion outcomes
- **Low infrastructure + Low mobility** = Major barrier to inclusion
- **Compensation**: High mobility can partially offset low infrastructure, and vice versa

### Real-world Examples

**Urban Professional (High Inclusion)**
- Infrastructure: 8/12 facilities nearby
- Mobility: 2.5 (visits urban areas weekly)
- Result: Very high formal inclusion likelihood

**Rural Farmer (Low Inclusion)**
- Infrastructure: 1/12 facilities nearby
- Mobility: 5.0 (rarely leaves village)
- Result: Low formal inclusion likelihood

**Market Trader (Medium Inclusion)**
- Infrastructure: 2/12 facilities nearby
- Mobility: 2.0 (daily market trips to town)
- Result: Moderate inclusion - mobility compensates for infrastructure

## Data Source
- **PC1 columns**: `pc1_1` through `pc1_12` in A2F_2023_complete.csv
- **PC3 columns**: `pc3_1` through `pc3_6` in A2F_2023_complete.csv
- Both sourced from Access to Finance 2023 survey by EFInA

---

## Model Integration
- **Total Features**: 64 (23 base + 5 age groups + 36 states)
- **Feature Order**: Infrastructure (#21), Mobility (#22)
- **Standardization**: Z-score normalization applied
- **Reference Values**: Infrastructure=3, Mobility=4 (defaults)

---

## Usage in Dashboard

### Individual Mode
1. **Infrastructure Access Slider**: 0-12 facilities
2. **Mobility Index Slider**: 1-6 scale

### Population Mode
Policy scenarios can adjust these values:
- **Infrastructure expansion**: Increase Infrastructure_Access_Index
- **Transport improvements**: Decrease Mobility_Index (more mobility)
- **Mobile money rollout**: Compensate for infrastructure gaps

---

## Key Insights

1. **Infrastructure matters most**: 3rd highest coefficient among new variables
2. **Mobility is protective**: Higher mobility protects against exclusion
3. **Urban advantage**: Urban areas have 5.2 avg facilities vs 1.8 in rural
4. **Age interaction**: Older adults (65+) have lower mobility, compounding exclusion
5. **Gender gap**: Women report lower mobility, partially explaining gender inclusion gap
