# Dashboard Improvements - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Date: October 13, 2024

Based on user questions and feedback, the following improvements have been implemented to enhance model interpretability and user experience.

---

## ‚úÖ Implemented Changes

### 1. **State Selection Added** (Question #7)
**Location:** `IndividualMode.jsx` - Demographics section

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added dropdown with all 37 Nigerian states
- ‚úÖ States list: ABIA, ADAMAWA, AKWA-IBOM, ANAMBRA, BAUCHI, BAYELSA, BENUE, BORNO, CROSS RIVER, DELTA, EBONYI, EDO, EKITI, ENUGU, FCT ABUJA, GOMBE, IMO, JIGAWA, KADUNA, KANO, KATSINA, KEBBI, KOGI, KWARA, LAGOS, NASARAWA, NIGER, OGUN, ONDO, OSUN, OYO, PLATEAU, RIVERS, SOKOTO, TARABA, YOBE, ZAMFARA
- ‚úÖ Default state: LAGOS
- ‚úÖ State stored in component state (not used in model - display only)
- ‚úÖ Help text: "State of residence (for context only, doesn't affect prediction)"

**Impact:** Better geographic context without overfitting the model with 37 dummy variables.

---

### 2. **Contributing Factors - Percentage Display** (Question #8)
**Location:** `IndividualMode.jsx` - Feature Contributions section

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ **Before:** Showed raw contribution values (confusing units)
- ‚úÖ **After:** Shows percentage contribution to total score
- ‚úÖ Calculation: Each factor's absolute contribution / sum of all absolute contributions √ó 100
- ‚úÖ Display format: "25.3%" instead of "0.85"
- ‚úÖ Longer, clearer progress bars (full width, not constrained)
- ‚úÖ Added header row: "Factor | % of Score"
- ‚úÖ Increased from top 6 to top 8 factors
- ‚úÖ Added explanatory text: "Values show each factor's percentage contribution to your overall inclusion score. Higher percentages indicate stronger influence."
- ‚úÖ Color-coded bars match each feature's icon color

**Impact:** Users can now easily understand which factors matter most (e.g., "Education: 32.5% of score" is much clearer than "Education: 0.85").

---

### 3. **Conditional Logic for Savings Variables** (Question #9)
**Location:** `IndividualMode.jsx` - Savings Behavior section

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ "Saves Money" is now the master toggle
- ‚úÖ When "Saves Money" = No (0):
  - Automatically sets all dependent variables to 0:
    - Regular_Saver ‚Üí 0
    - Informal_Savings_Mode ‚Üí 0
    - Diverse_Savings_Reasons ‚Üí 0
    - Savings_Frequency_Score ‚Üí 0
    - Savings_Behavior_Score ‚Üí 0
    - savings_frequency_numeric ‚Üí 0
  - Shows orange notice: "Turn on 'Saves Money' above to adjust detailed savings behaviors"
  - Hides detailed savings controls

- ‚úÖ When "Saves Money" = Yes (1):
  - All detailed savings controls become visible and adjustable
  - Users can customize frequency, regularity, informal usage, diversity, scores

- ‚úÖ Old Age Planning remains independent (can have plan without active saving)

**Impact:** Better UX - prevents illogical combinations like "doesn't save money" but "is a regular saver". Clearer hierarchy of variables.

---

### 4. **Informal Savings Clarification Notice** (Question #4)
**Location:** `IndividualMode.jsx` - Savings Behavior section (top)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added prominent blue notice box at top of Savings Behavior card:
  
  ```
  üìò About Savings Measurement
  "Savings" includes informal methods 
  (saving at home, esusu/ajo/adashi groups, family/friends, assets). Informal savings 
  habits indicate financial discipline and readiness for formal services.
  ```

- ‚úÖ Uses blue color scheme (informational, not warning)
- ‚úÖ Info icon included
- ‚úÖ Explains that informal saving behavior predicts formal inclusion propensity

**Impact:** Critical clarification - users understand the model measures savings culture (formal + informal), not just formal account usage.

---

### 5. **Reorganized Savings Sections** (Question #10)
**Location:** `IndividualMode.jsx`

**Before:**
- "Savings Behavior" card (4 variables)
- "Financial Planning" card (4 variables)
- Variables split across two cards

**After:**
- ‚úÖ **Single "Savings Behavior" card** with all 8 savings-related variables
- ‚úÖ Better organization:
  1. Informal savings notice
  2. Saves Money (master toggle)
  3. Conditional section (only if Saves Money = Yes):
     - Savings Frequency
     - Regular Saver
     - Uses Informal Savings
     - Diverse Savings Reasons
     - Savings Frequency Score
     - Savings Behavior Score
  4. Old Age Planning (independent, separated by border)

**Impact:** Simpler, more intuitive layout. Clear hierarchy. Reduced visual clutter.

---

### 6. **Enhanced Toggle Components**
**Location:** `IndividualMode.jsx` - ToggleInput component

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `disabled` prop support
- ‚úÖ Disabled toggles show:
  - Grayed out appearance (opacity-50)
  - Cursor-not-allowed cursor
  - Orange helper text: "Enable 'Saves Money' to adjust this variable"
- ‚úÖ Disabled toggles cannot be clicked
- ‚úÖ Label text changes to gray when disabled

**Impact:** Better visual feedback for conditional logic. Users understand why certain controls are unavailable.

---

### 7. **Updated Feature Names in Contributions**
**Location:** `IndividualMode.jsx` - featureContributions

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ More descriptive names:
  - "Education" ‚Üí "Education Level"
  - "Wealth" ‚Üí "Wealth Quintile"
  - "Income" ‚Üí "Monthly Income"
  - "Urban" ‚Üí "Urban Location"
- ‚úÖ Added "Runs Out of Money" to tracked contributions
- ‚úÖ Moved "Savings Frequency" into contributions (was missing)

**Impact:** Clearer labeling in the contributing factors visualization.

## üîÑ Variable Info Page Updates (Next Phase)

The following updates to `VariableInfo.jsx` are documented but **not yet implemented**:

### Updates Needed:

1. **Add explanatory notes for counterintuitive coefficients:**
   - `runs_out_of_money` (+0.243): Why positive? ‚Üí Signals need for formal services
   - `Old_Age_Planning` (-0.044): Why negative? ‚Üí May rely on informal mechanisms
   - Savings scores (weak negative): Multicollinearity with component variables

2. **Update all savings variable descriptions:**
   - Mention informal methods in every savings variable
   - List examples: esusu, ajo, adashi, saving at home, etc.
   - Explain why informal habits predict formal inclusion

3. **Reorganize Variable Info sections:**
   - Move "Savings Frequency" into "Savings Behavior" section
   - Total sections: Demographics (4), Economic (4), Savings Behavior (8)

**Status:** Documented in `MODEL_INTERPRETATION_CLARIFICATIONS.md` and `DASHBOARD_IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md`
