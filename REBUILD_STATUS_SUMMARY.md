## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS: All 7 Missing Variables Found and Tested!**

### **Test Results (1,000 row sample from AF2023_Efina.xlsx):**

| Variable | Status | % with Feature | Mean Value |
|----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Has_NIN** | ‚úÖ Working | 70.6% have NIN | 0.706 |
| **Formal_Employment** | ‚úÖ Working | 9.6% employed | 0.096 |
| **Business_Income** | ‚úÖ Working | 25.5% have business | 0.255 |
| **Agricultural_Income** | ‚úÖ Working | 32.8% have agricultural | 0.328 |
| **Passive_Income** | ‚úÖ Working | 0.8% have passive income | 0.008 |
| **Income_Diversity_Score** | ‚úÖ Working | Mean 0.69 sources | 0.69 |
| **Digital_Access_Index** | ‚úÖ Working | Mean 1.42 (0-2 scale) | 1.42 |

## üìä **What This Means:**

### **1. Data Quality - Excellent! ‚úÖ**
- **70.6% have NIN** - This is a VERY strong predictor (people need NIN to open bank accounts)
- **25.5% have business income** - Good variation, will be predictive
- **32.8% have agricultural income** - Substantial rural representation
- **9.6% formally employed** - Lower than expected, but realistic for Nigeria
- **Digital Access Index = 1.42** - Most people have mobile phones + some have reliable network

### **2. Expected Model Performance:**

**Current Model (without these variables):**
- Test Accuracy: 75.56%
- Test AUC: 0.8354

**Expected with ALL variables:**
- **Test Accuracy: 78-80%** (+2.5-4.5 pp improvement)
- **Test AUC: 0.86-0.88** (+0.025-0.045 improvement)

### **3. Most Impactful New Variables (Predicted):**

1. **Has_NIN** ‚Üí Coefficient: **+0.4 to +0.6** (HUGE positive effect)
   - Rationale: You literally cannot open a bank account without NIN in Nigeria
   
2. **Digital_Access_Index** ‚Üí Coefficient: **+0.3 to +0.5**
   - Rationale: Mobile money requires a phone + network
   
3. **Formal_Employment** ‚Üí Coefficient: **+0.2 to +0.4**
   - Rationale: Employers require bank accounts for salary payments
   
4. **Business_Income** ‚Üí Coefficient: **+0.1 to +0.3**
   - Rationale: Business owners need accounts for transactions
   
5. **Income_Diversity_Score** ‚Üí Coefficient: **+0.05 to +0.15**
   - Rationale: More income sources = more financial sophistication
   
6. **Agricultural_Income** ‚Üí Coefficient: **-0.05 to +0.05** (weak/neutral)
   - Rationale: Agricultural sector often excluded from formal finance
   
7. **Passive_Income** ‚Üí Coefficient: **+0.15 to +0.30**
   - Rationale: Indicates wealth, but only 0.8% have it (low impact due to rarity)

## üéØ **Next Steps:**

### **Step 1: Run Full Rebuild Script ‚è≥**

**Script:** `rebuild_complete_model_from_excel.py`

**Status:** 
- ‚úÖ Script created and ready
- ‚úÖ Test successful (1,000 rows)
- ‚è≥ Full rebuild needs to run (28,392 rows)

**Action:** Execute the full rebuild script on all 28K+ rows

**Estimated time:** 2-3 minutes for full dataset

---

### **Step 2: Validate Model Performance ‚úÖ**

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All 7 new variables have non-zero coefficients
- [ ] Test accuracy improves by at least 1.5 pp
- [ ] Test AUC improves by at least 0.015
- [ ] NIN has strongest positive coefficient among new variables
- [ ] No data leakage (all variables are pre-account)

---

### **Step 3: Update Dashboard üé®**

**Files to Update:**

1. **`dashboard/src/utils/prediction.js`**
   - Add 7 new features to coefficient dictionary
   - Update scaler mean/scale arrays (58 features)
   - Update feature list

2. **`dashboard/src/components/IndividualMode.jsx`**
   - Add NIN toggle ("Do you have a National ID (NIN) card?")
   - Add Employment toggle ("Are you formally employed?")
   - Add Business toggle ("Do you own/operate a business?")
   - Add Agricultural toggle ("Do you earn from farming?")
   - Add Passive Income toggle ("Do you have passive income?")
   - Add Income Diversity slider (0-5+)
   - Add Digital Access slider (0-2: No phone, Phone only, Phone + Network)

3. **`dashboard/src/components/VariableInfo.jsx`**
   - Add documentation for 7 new variables
   - Explain why each matters
   - Show coefficient ranges

4. **`regenerate_population_data.py`**
   - Update to use 58-feature model
   - Generate population with all 7 new variables
   - Realistic distributions matching test data

---

### **Step 4: Testing & Validation üß™**

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **NIN Effect Test:**
   - Same profile, toggle NIN on/off
   - Expected: +5-10% prediction change

2. **Employment Effect Test:**
   - Same profile, toggle employment on/off
   - Expected: +3-7% prediction change

3. **Digital Access Effect Test:**
   - Same profile, change digital access 0 ‚Üí 2
   - Expected: +4-8% prediction change

4. **Cumulative Effect Test:**
   - Start with low-inclusion profile (rural, no education, no income)
   - Add: NIN + Employment + Digital Access
   - Expected: +15-25% prediction increase

---

## üìà **Expected Business Impact:**

### **1. Better Policy Targeting:**
- **NIN Campaign:** If someone has NIN but no account, they're "low-hanging fruit"
- **Digital Infrastructure:** Focus on areas with low Digital Access Index
- **Employment Programs:** Formal employment drives inclusion

### **2. More Accurate Predictions:**
- Current model: 75.56% accurate
- New model: ~78-80% accurate
- **Impact:** 300-450 more people correctly classified out of 17,000 test set

### **3. Deeper Insights:**
- Understand **why** someone is excluded (no NIN? no phone? no job?)
- Design targeted interventions based on specific gaps

## üìù **Technical Notes:**

### **Why the Previous Attempt Failed:**
- Excel file (AF2023_Efina.xlsx) has `respondent_serial` IDs: 3697287, 3546312...
- Cleaned CSV (modeling_dataset_non_circular.csv) has IDs: 464630, 464632...
- **0% overlap** ‚Üí Merge failed ‚Üí All new variables became zeros

### **Solution:**
- Start fresh from Excel file (AF2023_Efina.xlsx)
- Re-engineer ALL features from scratch
- No merging needed - all data in one place

### **Data Source Confirmed:**
- **File:** `dataset/AF2023_Efina.xlsx`
- **Rows:** 28,392 (full survey)
- **Columns:** 37 (includes all needed variables)
- **Quality:** Good - all 7 new variables have realistic distributions

---

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion:**

We've successfully identified and tested all 7 missing variables. The data exists, the approach works, and we're ready for the full model rebuild.

**Next Action:** Execute `rebuild_complete_model_from_excel.py` on the full dataset to generate the final 58-feature model with all missing variables included.

**Expected Completion:** 5-10 minutes for full rebuild + testing

**Expected Outcome:** A significantly more accurate and interpretable model (+2-4 pp accuracy improvement)
