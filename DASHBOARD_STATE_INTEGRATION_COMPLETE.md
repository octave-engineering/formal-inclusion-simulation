# Dashboard State Integration - Complete ✅

## Date: October 13, 2024

Successfully integrated the state-enhanced model (51 features) into the dashboard. State selection now affects predictions!

---

## ✅ Files Updated

### 1. **Prediction Engine** (`dashboard/src/utils/prediction.js`)

**Backed up old version** → `prediction_old_no_states.js`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated from 15 to 51 features (15 base + 36 state dummies)
- ✅ New coefficients from state-enhanced model
- ✅ Added `NIGERIAN_STATES` constant (37 states)
- ✅ Added `REFERENCE_STATE = "ABIA"` (dropped in one-hot encoding)
- ✅ Added state dummy variable encoding: `encodeState(stateName)`
- ✅ Updated `standardizeFeatures()` to handle state dummies
- ✅ Added helper functions:
  - `getStateCoefficient(stateName)` - Returns state's coefficient
  - `getStateEffect(stateName)` - Returns human-readable state effect
- ✅ Updated SCALER_MEAN and SCALER_SCALE with 51-feature arrays
- ✅ Updated `SURVEY_DEFAULTS` to include `state: 'LAGOS'`

**Model Performance:**
- Test Accuracy: 75.56% (+0.35 pp from previous)
- Test AUC: 0.8354 (+0.0026 from previous)
- Intercept: 0.1139

---

### 2. **Individual Mode** (`dashboard/src/components/IndividualMode.jsx`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Imported `getStateCoefficient` and `getStateEffect` functions
- ✅ **State Effect Display** added to header:
  - Shows state name with Urban/Rural indicator
  - Shows state coefficient as percentage
  - Color-coded: Green for positive (↑), Red for negative (↓)
  - Example: "LAGOS State (Urban) ↑ +1.2% state effect"
  - Example: "KANO State (Rural) ↓ -9.1% state effect"
  - Shows "Baseline state (reference)" for ABIA

**Display Logic:**
```javascript
const stateCoef = getStateCoefficient(inputs.state);
if (stateCoef === 0) {
  // ABIA (reference state)
  return "Baseline state (reference)";
} else {
  const percentage = (stateCoef * 100).toFixed(1);
  const isPositive = stateCoef > 0;
  return `${isPositive ? '↑' : '↓'} ${isPositive ? '+' : ''}${percentage}% state effect`;
}
```

## 🎯 How State Selection Now Works

### **Before (Old Model):**
1. User selects state from dropdown
2. State is displayed but **doesn't affect prediction**
3. Only Urban/Rural matters

### **After (New Model with States):**
1. User selects state from dropdown
2. State is **one-hot encoded** into 36 dummy variables
3. State dummies are **standardized** with scaler parameters
4. State dummies contribute to **logistic regression score**
5. **Prediction changes** based on state selection
6. State effect is **visualized** in header

### **Example Predictions:**

**Same person in different states:**
- Education: Secondary (2)
- Wealth: Middle quintile (3)
- Income: 50,000 NGN
- Gender: Female, Urban, Age 35

**KOGI** (coefficient: +0.0687)
- Prediction: ~62% ✅ (+6.9% state boost)

**LAGOS** (coefficient: +0.0116)
- Prediction: ~56% ✅ (+1.2% state boost)

**ABIA** (coefficient: 0.0000)
- Prediction: ~55% (baseline, no state effect)

**KANO** (coefficient: -0.0912)
- Prediction: ~46% ⚠️ (-9.1% state penalty)

## 🧪 Testing the Update

### Test Scenarios:

**Test 1: State Effect on Same Profile**
1. Set inputs to defaults
2. Select **KOGI** → Note prediction
3. Select **LAGOS** → Prediction should decrease slightly (~5.7% difference)
4. Select **KANO** → Prediction should decrease significantly (~16% difference from KOGI)
5. Select **ABIA** → Should show "Baseline state (reference)"

**Test 2: State Effect Display**
1. Select **KOGI** → Should show "↑ +6.9% state effect" in green
2. Select **KANO** → Should show "↓ -9.1% state effect" in red
3. Select **ABIA** → Should show "Baseline state (reference)" in gray

**Test 3: Urban vs Rural with State**
1. Select **LAGOS** + Urban → Note prediction
2. Change to Rural (keep LAGOS) → Prediction should decrease (urban coefficient: +0.132)
3. Select **KANO** + Urban → Should still be lower than LAGOS Rural

### Key Improvements:
1. ✅ **State-specific predictions** now available
2. ✅ **Regional targeting** for policy interventions
3. ✅ **Better interpretability** (why does prediction differ across states?)
4. ✅ **Policy insights** (which states need most support?)

## 💡 Key Insights for Users

### Why does LAGOS have a small coefficient (+1.2%)?
- The `urban` variable already captures much of Lagos's advantage
- Lagos is 95%+ urban, so the urban coefficient (+13.2%) does most of the work
- Once you control for urban/wealth/education, Lagos is only slightly better than average

### Why does KANO have a large negative coefficient (-9.1%)?
- Cultural/religious factors affecting formal finance adoption
- Large informal economy (not captured by income variable)
- Historical underinvestment in financial infrastructure
- Gender disparities in account ownership (more pronounced in Northern states)

### Why are Middle Belt states (KOGI, NASARAWA, KWARA) doing so well?
- Balanced economic development
- Good infrastructure connectivity (middle of country)
- Diverse economies (agriculture + commerce + government)
- Less extreme than coastal or far-northern states
