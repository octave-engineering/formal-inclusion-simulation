# Implementation Summary - Non-Circular Model Integration

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Problem Statement
The EFInA team identified that the original model included circular variables - features that already indicate formal financial inclusion (e.g., having a bank account, using mobile money). This creates circular logic where the model predicts inclusion based on variables that require being included.

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Analysis ✅ COMPLETE

1. **Savings Behavior Analysis** (`savings_behavior_analysis.py`)
   - Analyzed A2F_2023_complete.csv dataset
   - Identified savings columns (SA1, SA2, SA3, SA4a, SA6, SA7a)
   - Created 7 non-circular savings behavior features
   - Results saved in `savings_behavior_results/`

2. **Circular Variables Identification** (`identify_circular_variables.py`)
   - Analyzed existing modeling dataset
   - Identified 11 circular variables to remove
   - Documented correlations and recommendations
   - Results saved in `circular_variables_analysis/`

### Phase 2: Dataset Rebuild ✅ COMPLETE

3. **Dataset Reconstruction** (`rebuild_dataset_non_circular.py`)
   - Removed 11 circular variables
   - Merged 7 savings behavior features
   - Created clean dataset with 39 columns
   - Extracted 15 modeling features
   - Results saved in `rebuilt_dataset/`

### Phase 3: Model Retraining ✅ COMPLETE

4. **Logistic Regression Retraining** (`retrain_model_non_circular.py`)
   - Trained on 85,341 samples
   - 15 non-circular features
   - Performance: 75.2% accuracy, 0.833 AUC
   - Results saved in `new_model_results/`

### Phase 4: Dashboard Update ✅ PARTIAL

   - ⏳ Add savings promotion policies
   - ⏳ Update baseline calculations

8. **Variable Info Page** (`dashboard/src/components/VariableInfo.jsx`)

## Key Insights

### 1. Savings Behavior Features Have Negative Coefficients
This is **expected and correct**:
- People who save informally are LESS likely to be formally included
- They use informal channels INSTEAD of formal ones
- This validates we're measuring propensity, not existing inclusion

### 2. Top Predictors Are Structural
- Education (0.779) and Wealth (0.764) are strongest
- These are harder to change but most impactful
- Policy focus should be on education and economic empowerment

### 3. Behavioral Features Are Weak Predictors
- Savings behavior features have small coefficients
- This suggests formal inclusion is driven more by structural factors
- Behavioral interventions alone may not be sufficient

## Remaining Work

### Critical (Required for Deployment)
1. **Simplify Individual Mode**
   - Create new input component with 15 features only
   - Group by: Demographics, Economic, Behavioral
   - Add tooltips and help text

2. **Update Policy Mode**
   - Remove circular policy levers
   - Add: Education, Wealth, Income, Savings Promotion
   - Simplify simulation logic

3. **Regenerate Population Data**
   - Merge savings features with population
   - Generate new predictions
   - Validate data quality

### Important (For Complete Experience)
4. **Update Variable Info**
   - Document all 15 features
   - Explain circular variable removal
   - Add model methodology

5. **Testing**

## Recommendations for EFInA Team

1. **Accept the Performance Trade-off**
   - 5% accuracy loss is acceptable for removing circular logic
   - Model is now measuring propensity, not existing inclusion
   - Results are more actionable for policy

2. **Focus on Structural Interventions**
   - Education and wealth are strongest predictors
   - Behavioral interventions alone are insufficient
   - Multi-pronged approach needed

3. **Interpret Savings Features Carefully**
   - Negative coefficients don't mean savings are bad
   - They indicate informal savers are less formally included
   - Opportunity to convert informal savers to formal channels

4. **Use for Policy Simulation**
   - Model is now suitable for "what-if" scenarios
   - Can test impact of education, wealth, savings programs
   - Results are interpretable and defensible
